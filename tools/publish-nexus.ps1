# API v3, documented at https://api-docs.nexusmods.com. The upload is four steps:
#   POST /uploads                  -> upload id + presigned S3 URL
#   PUT  <presigned url>           -> the bytes
#   POST /uploads/{id}/finalise    -> close the session
#   POST /mod-files/{id}/versions  -> turn it into a new version of the main file
# then POST /mods/{id}/changelogs for the changelog.
#
# Note on stability: /uploads is a stable endpoint, but the mod-file endpoints carry
# Nexus's own "Experimental" badge - they may change or be withdrawn. If a release
# fails here, the site's upload form still works and is the fallback.
